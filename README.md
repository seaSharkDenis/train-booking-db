### Train Booking Management System

The Train Booking Management System is an open-source project designed to help learners understand how to manage and structure databases effectively in the context of a real-world application. The system aims to simulate the process of booking train tickets, managing customer data, and handling reservation details. Learners will gain hands-on experience with database design, including creating tables, defining relationships, and understanding normalization principles. 

### Objective
This challenge is designed to help learners understand and implement database design principles, including:
1. Structuring tables for efficient data management.
2. Implementing relationships between tables.
3. Normalizing data to avoid redundancy and improve data integrity.
4. Creating queries to handle user requests (e.g., booking, viewing reservations).

Through this project, learners will build foundational knowledge in database management, preparing them for more advanced topics in software development and database administration.
